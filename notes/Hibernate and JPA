JPA (Java Persistence API):
--------------------------
The Java Persistence API provides a specification for persisting, reading, and managing data from your Java object to relational tables in the database.

Mapping JAVA objects to database tables is called ORM (Object relational mapping). JPA is one possible approach to ORM.
JPA permits the developer to work directly with objects rather than with SQL statements. The JPA implementation is typically called persistence provider like Hibernate, Eclipse Link, etc

JPA Entity:
An entity represents a table in database and each entity instance corresponds to a row in the table.
Entity class are annotated by @Entity
