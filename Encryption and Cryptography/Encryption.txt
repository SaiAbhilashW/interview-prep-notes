encryption at rest
encryption for data transfer

openssl rand 8 -hex
gives a random 8 bit hexadecimal key

key space - amount of possible values inside the key
4 bit value -> 16 possible values

plain text --key--> encrypted text --same key--> plain text

Cipher algorithm:
Block Cipher 
- usually encrypts 64,128,196 bits of data at a time
- Slower
- good to encrypt stored data
- DES, 3DES, AES


Stream Cipher
- encrypts 1 bit or 8 bit chunks of data at a time
- faster
- good for encrypting real time data
- video, voice encryption


Substitution and Transposition:

Substitution:
Substitute the chars with other chars
Only you will have the mapping used 

2bit block cipher - takes to bits at a time, encrypts them, joins them back to the rest again
